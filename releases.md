From version 1.2 any publication will includes all U2F firmware files for 40 & 80 Columns.

A thirds number in publication (eg: 1.1.1, 1.1.x) refers to an intermediate development version until it is finally published as a major version (say 1.2).

## Version 1.2.1 - (on going)

### Features
n/a

### Fix & Improvement
* Single __tusb_config.h__ definition: move `tusb_config.h` to /common (make tusb_config.h symbolic link from /40col and /80col to ../common/tusb_config.h)
* Remove `_TUSB_CONFIG_H_` definition from `main.h` (they are not compliled, `tusb_config.h` takes priority).

## Version 1.2 - Oct 24 2022

### Features
* Debug uart on GP28 (see [debug.md](debug.md) for details).
* Display/Hide menu with CTRL+SHIFT+M (ESC will also quit).
* Adding color selection in Menu (80 cols only)
* Additionnal Keyboard Layouts
 * Added layout for keyboard FR & keyboard BE. Now supporting UK, US, DE, FR, BE.
 * Characters [,],{,},|,@,,# to F1...F8 (because of early AltGr detection)

 * the Keyboard layout used and its revision number

### Fix & Improvement
* Using GP28 as rx uart @ 115200 for `debug_print()`. See common/picoterm_debug.h.
  A global `debug_msg` buffer is available for sprintf() operation before debug_print() calls.
* Using `struct PicotermConfig` to hold software configuration parameter.
  Using `load_config` & `save_config` to load/save from flash.
	See common/picoterm_config.h
* Fix AltGR support for all keyboards (including BE & FR)
* pmhid.h : KEYMAP FR Rev 2 (fix issue on AltGR + 5).
* CMakeLists.txt : PICO_TINYUSB_PATH definition (to change TinyUSB under comment)
* Solve startup issue #7
* Readme (doc+cosmetic)
 * Some cosmetic updates (using table, add graphics).
 * Adding 'Adding a keyboard layout' section
 * Completing 'Building firmware from source" and add detailled 'compiling.md' file.
 * Adding 'Remarks' section with some tips.
* BIG IMPROVEMENT IN COMPILATION (CMakeLists.txt) [See details in Pull Request #8](https://github.com/RC2014Z80/picoterm/pull/8)
