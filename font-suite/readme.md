# Graphical fonts for PicoTerm

Picoterm support 2 types of fonts:

__Non graphical font__:

ASCII/VT100 mode where only 7 bits are used. The 8Th bit is used to invert the character to be displayed. This feature is used a lot under CP/M and retro boards. This font is based on Ubuntu Mono and defines only the chars from 0x20 to 0x7E.<br />At any moment, the `\ESCG` allows the terminal to returns this mode.

__Graphical  font__:

ANSI mode where the 8th bit is used as part of charset encoding.<br/>When Picoterm receives a `\ESCF` it switch to graphical font.<br />This font is still based on Ubuntu Mono but includes lot additionnal chars. The font defines the chars from 0x20 to 0xFF.

Picoterm now support several graphical fonts (selected via the configuration screen).

| ID  | Name       | Description                                              |
|-----|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  	| NupetScii  | Initial extended graphical font combining lot of retro computer graphical chars<br />This page also contains ressource to draw graphical ressources with NupetSCII. |
| 2	  | CP437      | English IBM/MS-DOS Codepage used on a wide variety of computerized system  |


## NuPetSCII - ANSI font for semi-graphical rendering

The `font8.c` used in the original PicoTerm 80 column only defines the ASCII charset
(from 0 to 126. 127 is use for cursor display).

`font8.c` leaks of of nice graphical tile to create interface/forms/map/character/ (like Commodore 64 or Code Page 437 do have).

Extending ASCII charset would be a great idea to draw semi-graphical tables and rudimentary interfaces.

It is even possible to draw screen and maps by using the Playscii software (see further).

### NuPETSCII - ASCII charset for C256 Foenix

Here are the additionnal chars merged into the `font8.c` file.

```
font8.c + nupet.data ---( compile_font.py )---> nupetscii.c
```

### Credit
I discovered the NuPET font/charset designed by Tom Wilson on this [Stefany Allaire article](https://stefanyallaire.wixsite.com/website/forum/the-specifications/character-sets).

Tom did use its own [Character-Editor](https://github.com/tomxp411/Character-Editor) to design the NuPET ASCII charset (and many other). [Character-Editor](https://github.com/tomxp411/Character-Editor) is a Â¢# opensource projet written available on GitHub.

Tom Wilson gracefuly authorise the usage of its NuPet font design in PicoTerm. Thanks to him for its sharing.

## CP437 - IBM/MS-DOS Codepage for english based computer

English IBM/MS-DOS Codepage used on a wide variety of computerized system in the world.

This character set remains the primary set in the core of any EGA and VGA-compatible graphics card. Many file formats developed at the time of the IBM PC are based on code page 437 as well (source: [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437)).

![Codepage 437 on Picoterm](cp437-00.jpg)<br />Source: [Code page 437n wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437)

As NupetSCII, the `cp437.c` expand The `font8.c` (read details about NuPetScii to understand how it works).

```
font8.c + cp437.data ---( compile_font.py )---> cp437.c
```

## Drawing/Art with NuPetScii charset

If you want to draw screen or art with NuPetScii, you can use the [Playscii from JP Lebreton](https://jp.itch.io/playscii), an open-source software written in Python3.

This software can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. Linux version runs directly from source code.

### Add NuPetScii font to Playscii software

Some efforts have been made to create the NuPetSCII charset to create ressources with Playscii + NupetSCII.

 The current folder contains the [nupetscii-for-playscii.zip](nupetscii-for-playscii.zip) used to add NuPetScii font to PlayScii.

After installation of Playscii:
1. open the [nupetscii-for-playscii.zip](nupetscii-for-playscii.zip) archive.
2. extract the `nupetscii.char` and `nupetscii.png` files from the archive.
3. copy the files in the `/charsets` folder of Playscii software.

You can check that font is proprely installed by selecting the menu entry "char/color | Choose character set..." in the Playscii software.

### Create a NuPetScii art with Playscii Software

Playscii is a great Python software to create ASCII based ressource/art.

Here is the [docs/NupetSciiDemo.psci](../docs/docs/NupetSciiDemo.psci) 49 x 15 art created with PlayScii.

![NupetSciiDemo inside playscii software](../docs/_static/NupetSciiDemo.jpg)

The SPACEBAR is used to display/hide the toolbox.

![playscii toolbox](../docs/_static/playscii-toolbox.jpg)

In the toolbox, click on the "__Set__" to select the "__nupetscii__" character set.

<div style="border:solid blue; padding: 10px">

Remark:<br />The "__Palette__" option stays on "__c64_original__".<br />The color data is currently not used as Picoterm display monochrom content.</div>

![playscii select Charset](../docs/_static/playscii-select-font.jpg)

When finished, select the menu "File | Save as".

![playscii Save As](../docs/_static/playscii-save-as-01.jpg)

And give a name to your file. It will be saved with the `.psci` extension.

![playscii Save As](../docs/_static/playscii-save-as-02.jpg)

Checking the psci file content reveal a storage format based on JSON. The format is quite simple and straightforward.

![playscii psci equal JSON](../docs/_static/playscii-psci-format.jpg)

* The file contains __frames__
* Each __frame__ contains __layers__
* Each __layer__ contains __tiles__
* Each __tile__ being a char (index in the charset) with additionnal properties.

So, accessing the characters/tiles of our 49 x 15 art is done with the following python expression (where `data` contains the loaded JSON).

```
screen = data['frames'][0]['layers'][0]['tiles']
```

### Converting NupetScii art to Raw data & Hex

The [psci-extract.py](psci-extract.py) python script can be used to convert the Playscii file to something more appropriate for the RC2014 computer (or SCM).

```
== PlayScii extractor 0.1 ==
Extract RC2014 data from art/screen drawed with playscii
                  by Meurisse D.
USAGE:
  ./psci-extract.py <filename.psci> -r -h

<filename>  : the PlayScii saved file
-r          : Create the .raw binary file (see description here below).
-hex <addr> : Create an Intel Hex file to store the raw data from
              the given address (integer or hexadecimal like 0x8100).
-h          : display this help.

=== .raw format ===
W : 1 byte, column Width
H : 1 byte, row Height
Data: column*row continuous bytes, Art/Screen data from row[1] to row[H].
Each row having W bytes (1 byte per column).
```

The following command creates the raw file with the data (see description here upper). This binary file can be very useful to store data onto the file system in a simple format (eg: CP/M).

```
python psci-extract.py ../docs/NupetSciiDemo.psci -r
```

You can check the [NupetSciiDemo.raw](../docs/NupetSciiDemo.raw) file with an Hex Editor (the file is stored into the docs folder).



The following command create a HEX file (that can be uploaded to SCM) and store the data at a given address (0x8500 in the following example).

```
$ ./psci-extract.py ../docs/NupetSciiDemo.psci -hex 0x8500
NupetSciiDemo.psci to RC20214 SCM hex
source    : ../docs/NupetSciiDemo.psci
charset   : nupetscii
palette   : c64_original
size      : 49 x 15
layer name: Layer 1
data size : 737 bytes
target addr: 34048
file created @ ../docs/NupetSciiDemo.hex
```

You can check the [NupetSciiDemo.hex](../docs/NupetSciiDemo.hex) file stored into the docs folder.

# Activating Graphical ANSI font with Escape Sequence

NuPetScii can be activated from PicoTerm menu and with [ESC sequence (see README.md)](../README.md). So an application can request the terminal to switch to semi-graphical font (AKA NuPetScii) when needed.

See the examples described in the "[using-nupetscii.md](../docs/using-nupetscii.md)" document for more details.

# data file encoding

 The '.data' file is used to create the '.c' font compiled within Picoterm.

The file `nupetscii.data` contains the definition of the additional chars. This file will be compiled with the `compile_font.py` python script to generate the expanded font charset named `nupetscii.c` .

__Remarks__: the `compile_font.py` script will generates __locally__ all the '.c' font for picoterm. Then '.c' file must be __manually__ copied to the picoterm source code.

The `nupetscii.c` (and any other) file resulting from `compile_font.py` is the font file to be included within the PicoTerm sources.

Characters have the size of:
* 12px height * 8px wide (normal height)
* 15px height * 8px wide (extra height)

The char here below, sourced from nupetscii.data, is the biggest possible.

``` c
/* U+7F DEL=Frame (128) */
{.bitmap_index = @bitmap_index@, .adv_w = 128, .box_h = 15, .box_w = 8, .ofs_x = 0, .ofs_y = -3}
FFFFFFFF
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
F......F
FFFFFFFF
```

Y offet start at the bottom of char (the baseline). Descending chars like p,q use negative offset to properly align the char on the baseline.

The font can have 15 row height at the maximum with a descending offset of 3 pixels (-3). Normal characters (limited to the baseline) do makes 12 rows.

The original font is coded with 4 bit per pixel (4 bpp), so with values from 0 to F for each point.

The hexadecimal notation (0 to F) are used in the data file (one letter for each 4bpp entry)!

The dot is used inplace of "0" to improve the readability.
